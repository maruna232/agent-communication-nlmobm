| Authentication | Secure tokens | JWT with appropriate expiration and refresh mechanism |
| API Communication | HTTPS | TLS 1.3 for all external API calls |
| WebSocket | Secure WebSockets | WSS protocol with message authentication |
| Third-party Access | OAuth scopes | Minimal permission scopes for Google Calendar |

**Data Protection Strategy:**
- No sensitive user data transmitted to servers except when required for API calls
- End-to-end encryption for all agent-to-agent communication
- Transparent data usage with clear user consent for all operations
- Regular security audits and dependency updates

## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### 5.1.1 System Overview

The AI Agent Network employs a **local-first, privacy-centric architecture** with a distributed communication model. The system follows these key architectural principles:

- **Local-First Data Storage**: All user data, preferences, and agent configurations are stored locally on the user's device using IndexedDB or SQLite with encryption, ensuring maximum privacy.

- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Agents communicate directly with each other via WebSockets, with a lightweight server acting only as a message router without storing conversation content.

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The system uses an event-driven approach for real-time updates and notifications between components.

- **Microservices for External Integrations**: External services like calendar integration and authentication are implemented as loosely coupled microservices.

- **Privacy by Design**: End-to-end encryption for all agent communications, with no central storage of user data or conversations.

The system boundaries are clearly defined with the frontend application running in the user's browser, communicating with a minimal backend that handles only WebSocket routing and authentication verification. External integrations are limited to authentication (Firebase) and calendar services (Google Calendar).

#### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Interface | Provide intuitive interface for agent interaction and configuration | React, Next.js, TailwindCSS | Responsive design, accessibility, transparent agent communication display |
| Local Storage Manager | Securely store and retrieve user data and preferences | IndexedDB/SQLite, Encryption Library | Data privacy, encryption, storage limitations |
| Agent Engine | Process natural language, manage agent state, execute tasks | OpenAI GPT-4o, Local Storage | AI model performance, prompt engineering, context management |
| WebSocket Communication | Enable secure agent-to-agent messaging | Socket.io, Encryption Library | Connection reliability, message delivery guarantees, security |
| Calendar Integration | Sync with Google Calendar for scheduling | Google Calendar API, OAuth | Permission scopes, sync frequency, conflict resolution |
| Authentication Service | Manage user identity and security | Firebase Authentication | Token management, session security, permission validation |

#### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

The system's data flow begins with user authentication via Firebase, which establishes a secure session. User preferences, calendar data, and agent configurations are stored locally in the browser using IndexedDB or SQLite with encryption. When a user issues a natural language command, the Agent Engine processes it using OpenAI's GPT-4o, determining if agent-to-agent communication is required.

For scheduling tasks, the agent retrieves calendar data from local storage (previously synced with Google Calendar) to determine availability. When communicating with another user's agent, a WebSocket connection is established through the WebSocket Server, which acts only as a message router. All messages are end-to-end encrypted, ensuring the server cannot read message contents.

Agents exchange structured JSON messages containing scheduling proposals, preferences, and availability information. These exchanges are displayed to users in a human-readable format. Once both users approve a scheduling proposal, the agents create calendar events locally and then sync them to Google Calendar.

The system maintains a clear separation between local data (stored on device) and transit data (encrypted during WebSocket communication), with no persistent storage of user data or conversations on the server.

| Authentication | Firebase + JWT | Custom Auth, Session Cookies | Leverages Firebase security; stateless authentication for scaling; industry standard |
| Data Encryption | AES-256 | RSA, ChaCha20 | Strong symmetric encryption for local data; widely implemented; good performance |

### 5.4 CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

#### 5.4.1 Monitoring and Observability Approach

The system implements a privacy-respecting monitoring approach that focuses on service health rather than user data:

- **WebSocket Server Monitoring**: Connection counts, message throughput, error rates
- **Client-Side Performance Metrics**: UI rendering times, API response times (anonymized)
- **Error Tracking**: Aggregated error reports without personal data
- **Usage Analytics**: Opt-in anonymous usage statistics

All monitoring respects user privacy by avoiding collection of personal data or conversation content. Metrics are aggregated and anonymized before transmission to monitoring systems.

#### 5.4.2 Logging and Tracing Strategy

| Log Type | Implementation | Retention | Privacy Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Application Logs | Client-side only | User-controlled | Stored locally, not transmitted |
| Error Logs | Anonymized reports | 30 days | No personal data or conversation content |
| Performance Traces | Sampling-based | 7 days | Aggregated metrics only |
| Security Events | Server-side audit log | 90 days | Authentication events only, no content |

The logging strategy emphasizes privacy by keeping detailed logs on the client device and only sending anonymized error reports when explicitly approved by users. Server-side logs are limited to connection metadata without message content.

#### 5.4.3 Error Handling Patterns

The system implements a comprehensive error handling strategy with graceful degradation:

- **Network Errors**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **API Failures**: Fallback to cached data with clear user notification
- **Storage Limitations**: Proactive warnings and data pruning options
- **Authentication Issues**: Automatic token refresh with graceful re-authentication

All errors are presented to users with clear explanations and actionable recovery steps. Critical errors that prevent core functionality trigger specific recovery workflows.

    F --> F1{Auth Error Type}
    F1 -->|Token Expired| F2[Token Refresh]
    F1 -->|Invalid Token| F3[Re-authentication]
```

#### 5.4.4 Authentication and Authorization Framework

The system uses a multi-layered authentication and authorization approach:

- **User Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with multiple provider options
- **Service Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 for Google Calendar with minimal scopes
- **Agent Communication**: JWT-based authentication for WebSocket connections
- **Local Data Access**: Encryption keys derived from authentication credentials

Authorization is managed through explicit user consent for all operations, with clear permission requests and the ability to revoke access at any time.

#### 5.4.5 Performance Requirements and SLAs

| Component | Metric | Target | Critical Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Interface | Initial Load Time | < 2 seconds | < 5 seconds |
| Agent Response | Command Processing | < 3 seconds | < 8 seconds |
| WebSocket | Message Delivery | < 500ms | < 2 seconds |
| Calendar Operations | Event Creation | < 3 seconds | < 10 seconds |
| Local Storage | Data Retrieval | < 100ms | < 500ms |

The system is designed to operate effectively even under suboptimal conditions, with graceful degradation when performance targets cannot be met. Users are notified of performance issues with clear status indicators.

#### 5.4.6 Disaster Recovery Procedures

The system implements several disaster recovery mechanisms:

- **Local Data Backup**: Optional encrypted export of user data
- **Connection Recovery**: Automatic reconnection with session resumption
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Validation of local storage on startup
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic handling of calendar conflicts

In case of catastrophic failure, the system provides clear recovery paths with minimal data loss due to the local-first architecture. The WebSocket server implements redundancy to ensure communication availability.

| WebSocket Relay Service | Agent message routing | Socket.io | None (transit only) |
| Local Storage Service | User data persistence | IndexedDB/SQLite API | User device |
| Agent Engine | Natural language processing | OpenAI API | Local with API calls |
| Calendar Integration | Schedule management | Google Calendar API | Local cache, Google |

The system architecture emphasizes clear separation of concerns with well-defined boundaries:

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user identity but stores minimal user data
- **WebSocket Relay**: Acts only as a message router without persisting conversation content
- **Local Storage**: Maintains all user preferences and agent configurations locally
- **Agent Engine**: Processes commands locally, making external API calls only when needed
- **Calendar Integration**: Syncs with external calendar while maintaining local cache

#### Inter-service Communication Patterns

| Communication Path | Pattern | Protocol | Data Format |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Client ↔ Authentication | Request/Response | HTTPS | JSON/JWT |
| Agent ↔ Agent | Publish/Subscribe | WebSocket | Encrypted JSON |
| Client ↔ Local Storage | Direct API | Browser API | Structured Objects |
| Agent ↔ OpenAI | Request/Response | HTTPS | JSON |
| Client ↔ Calendar | Request/Response | HTTPS/OAuth | JSON |

    end
    
    subgraph "External Services"
        F
        H
    end
```

#### Service Discovery and Load Balancing

Given the lightweight nature of the system, service discovery is simplified:

| Service | Discovery Mechanism | Load Balancing Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WebSocket Relay | DNS with static endpoints | Round-robin DNS |
| Authentication | Firebase configuration | Managed by Firebase |
| OpenAI API | Static configuration | Managed by OpenAI |
| Calendar API | OAuth discovery | Managed by Google |

The WebSocket Relay Service is the primary component requiring load balancing, implemented through:
- Stateless design allowing any server to handle any message
- Socket.io's built-in Redis adapter for session sharing across instances
- Round-robin DNS for initial connection distribution

#### Circuit Breaker and Resilience Patterns

| Service | Circuit Breaker Implementation | Retry Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WebSocket Relay | Connection health monitoring | Exponential backoff |
| OpenAI API | Request timeout with fallback | Limited retries (3) |
| Calendar API | Error rate monitoring | Incremental backoff |
| Local Storage | Storage health checks | Alternative storage fallback |

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Error threshold exceeded
    Open --> HalfOpen: Timeout period elapsed
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Success threshold met
    HalfOpen --> Open: Errors continue
    Open --> [*]
    
    note right of Closed
        Normal operation
        Tracking error rate
    end note
    
    note right of Open
        Requests fail fast
        No external calls
        Using fallback responses
    end note
    
    note right of HalfOpen
        Limited test requests
        Monitoring success rate
    end note
```

### 6.1.2 SCALABILITY DESIGN

#### Scaling Approach

The system employs a hybrid scaling strategy:

| Component | Scaling Approach | Scaling Triggers | Resource Allocation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WebSocket Relay | Horizontal | Connection count, message rate | Container instances |
| Client Application | Vertical (browser) | N/A (client-side) | Progressive enhancement |
| Local Storage | Vertical | Data volume | Storage quota management |
| Agent Engine | Optimized usage | Token count, request frequency | Request batching |

The primary scalable component is the WebSocket Relay Service, which follows these principles:
- Stateless design allowing horizontal scaling
- Connection sharing via Redis adapter
- Container-based deployment for rapid scaling

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Load Balancer] --> B[WebSocket Relay 1]
    A --> C[WebSocket Relay 2]
    A --> D[WebSocket Relay 3]
    
    B --> E[Redis Adapter]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    
    F[Client 1] --> A
    G[Client 2] --> A
    H[Client 3] --> A
    I[Client 4] --> A
    
    subgraph "Auto-scaling Group"
        B
        C
        D
    end
```

#### Auto-scaling Configuration

| Component | Scale-Out Trigger | Scale-In Trigger | Scaling Limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WebSocket Relay | >70% CPU or >1000 connections per instance | <30% CPU for 10 minutes | Min: 2, Max: 10 |

#### Performance Optimization Techniques

| Component | Optimization Technique | Expected Improvement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Client Application | Code splitting and lazy loading | 40% reduction in initial load time |
| WebSocket Messages | Binary message format | 30% reduction in message size |
| Agent Engine | Prompt optimization and caching | 50% reduction in API tokens |
| Local Storage | Indexed queries and data pruning | 60% faster data retrieval |

#### Capacity Planning Guidelines

The system is designed to handle:
- Up to 10,000 concurrent users per WebSocket Relay cluster
- Average message size of 2KB with compression
- Peak traffic of 100 messages per second per instance
- Local storage requirements of ~50MB per user

Resource allocation follows these guidelines:
- 1 WebSocket Relay instance per 1,000 concurrent users
- Memory allocation of 512MB per WebSocket Relay instance
- CPU allocation of 0.5 cores per WebSocket Relay instance
- Network bandwidth of 10Mbps per 1,000 concurrent users

### 6.1.3 RESILIENCE PATTERNS

#### Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

| Component | Fault Tolerance Approach | Recovery Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WebSocket Relay | Multi-instance redundancy | Automatic reconnection |
| Local Storage | Data integrity validation | Backup restoration |
| Agent Engine | Graceful degradation | Simplified operation modes |
| Calendar Integration | Offline capability | Local cache with sync |

The system implements several fault tolerance patterns:
- No single point of failure in server components
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
- Local-first design ensures core functionality without connectivity

#### Disaster Recovery Procedures

| Scenario | Recovery Procedure | Recovery Time Objective |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WebSocket Service Failure | Automatic failover to backup instances | < 30 seconds |
| Data Corruption | Restore from local backup | < 5 minutes |
| API Service Unavailable | Switch to offline mode with limited functionality | < 10 seconds |
| Complete System Failure | Rebuild from infrastructure templates | < 30 minutes |

    X --> Y{Service Restored?}
    Y -->|Yes| Z[Sync Queued Operations]
    Y -->|No| X
    Z --> H
```

#### Data Redundancy Approach

The system employs a multi-layered data redundancy strategy:

| Data Type | Primary Storage | Backup Mechanism | Sync Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Preferences | IndexedDB | Exportable JSON | On significant changes |
| Agent Configuration | IndexedDB | Exportable JSON | On configuration changes |
| Conversation History | SQLite | Pruned with age | Real-time |
| Calendar Data | Local Cache | Google Calendar | Every 15 minutes |

#### Service Degradation Policies

When facing resource constraints or service failures, the system implements progressive degradation:

| Degradation Level | Triggered By | Available Functionality | User Experience |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Level 1 (Minor) | External API latency | All features with delays | Slower responses with indicators |
| Level 2 (Moderate) | WebSocket instability | Local features, delayed sync | Notification of connection issues |
| Level 3 (Significant) | API service unavailable | Local-only features | Offline mode indicator |
| Level 4 (Severe) | Local storage issues | Read-only emergency mode | Critical functionality only |

The system communicates degradation clearly to users with:
- Status indicators in the UI
- Explicit notifications for significant degradation
- Clear recovery steps when user action is required

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[System Monitoring] --> B{Service Status}
    
    B -->|All Services Operational| C[Full Functionality]
    B -->|External API Degraded| D[Level 1 Degradation]

    B -->|API Unavailable| F[Level 3 Degradation]
    B -->|Storage Issues| G[Level 4 Degradation]
    
    D --> H[Show Performance Warning]
    E --> I[Enable Offline Mode]
    F --> J[Disable External Features]
    G --> K[Emergency Read-Only Mode]

    M -->|No| O[Maintain Degraded State]
    
    N --> P[Notify User of Restoration]
    O --> Q[Provide Manual Recovery Steps]
```

## 6.2 DATABASE DESIGN

The AI Agent Network employs a local-first architecture with a focus on privacy and data ownership. Rather than using traditional server-side databases, the system primarily utilizes client-side storage mechanisms to keep user data on their devices.

### 6.2.1 SCHEMA DESIGN

| System | Maintenance only | Encryption boundaries | Integrity check |

### 6.2.4 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

#### Query Optimization Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation | Use Cases | Performance Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compound Indexes | Multi-field indexes | Filtered sorting queries | 50-80% faster lookups |
| Covering Indexes | Include frequently accessed fields | Common projections | 30-60% faster reads |
| Query Limiting | Result size restrictions | Pagination, previews | 70-90% reduced load time |
| Field Projection | Select only needed fields | Detail views, lists | 40-60% bandwidth reduction |

#### Caching Strategy

        P[API Responses - 15m TTL]
    end
    
    C --> Q[Client]
    G --> Q
```

#### Connection Pooling

For the WebSocket server component, connection pooling is implemented to manage agent-to-agent communications efficiently:

| Pool Type | Size | Idle Timeout | Reconnection Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WebSocket Connections | Dynamic (max 1000/instance) | 5 minutes | Exponential backoff |
| Database Connections | 5-10 per client | 2 minutes | Immediate retry (3x) |
| API Connections | 3-5 per service | 30 seconds | Exponential backoff |

#### Read/Write Optimization

| Technique | Implementation | Benefit | Trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Write Batching | Group writes in transactions | Reduced I/O operations | Slightly delayed persistence |
| Read Caching | Multi-level cache hierarchy | Faster repeated access | Memory usage |
| Lazy Loading | On-demand data retrieval | Reduced initial load time | Potential UI delays |
| Prefetching | Anticipatory data loading | Smoother user experience | Increased data usage |

#### Batch Processing Approach

| Process Type | Batch Size | Scheduling | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Message Syncing | 50 messages | On reconnection | High |
| Calendar Updates | 20 events | Every 15 minutes | Medium |
| Data Cleanup | 100 records | Daily | Low |
| Index Rebuilding | Full rebuild | Weekly | Background |

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

The AI Agent Network relies on several key integrations to provide its core functionality while maintaining its privacy-first approach. This section outlines the architecture for integrating with external systems and services, focusing on secure, efficient communication patterns that preserve user privacy.

### 6.3.1 API DESIGN

#### Protocol Specifications

| Protocol | Usage | Implementation | Security Measures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REST | External API communication | JSON over HTTPS | TLS 1.3, request signing |
| WebSocket | Agent-to-agent communication | Socket.io with custom protocol | End-to-end encryption, JWT auth |
| OAuth 2.0 | Third-party authorization | Standard flow with PKCE | Minimal scopes, token encryption |
| GraphQL | Not used (REST preferred) | N/A | N/A |

The system prioritizes standard, well-established protocols with proven security models:

- **REST APIs** for all external service communication (OpenAI, Google Calendar)
- **WebSockets** for real-time agent-to-agent communication
- **OAuth 2.0** for secure delegation of access to third-party services

#### Authentication Methods

| Auth Method | Used For | Token Lifetime | Refresh Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Firebase Auth | User authentication | 1 hour | Refresh token (14 days) |
| JWT | WebSocket connections | 1 hour | Re-authentication |
| OAuth 2.0 | Google Calendar access | 1 hour | Refresh token (until revoked) |
| API Keys | OpenAI API access | N/A | Rotation schedule |

Authentication implementation follows these principles:

- **User identity** managed through Firebase Authentication
- **Service-to-service** authentication using short-lived tokens
- **Third-party access** delegated through OAuth with minimal scopes
- **All tokens** stored locally with encryption

#### Authorization Framework

| Resource Type | Authorization Model | Permission Levels | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Data | Owner-only | Read/Write | Firebase Auth claims |
| Agent Communication | Explicit consent | Connect/Disconnect | Approved agent list |
| Calendar Access | Delegated | Read/Write/Free-busy | OAuth scopes |
| AI Model Access | Service-level | Query only | API key restrictions |

The authorization framework implements:

- **Principle of least privilege** for all integrations
- **Explicit user consent** required for all data access
- **Granular permissions** for external service access
- **Revocable access** for all authorization grants

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

| Integration Point | Rate Limit | Handling Strategy | Backoff Algorithm |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI API | Varies by tier | Token bucket with queuing | Exponential with jitter |
| Google Calendar API | 10,000/day | Leaky bucket with caching | Exponential with max cap |
| WebSocket Messages | 10/second per connection | Fixed window counter | Linear with retry limit |
| Firebase Auth | 100/hour per IP | IP-based throttling | Exponential with user notification |

Rate limiting implementation includes:

- **Client-side rate limiting** to prevent quota exhaustion
- **Intelligent retry logic** with appropriate backoff
- **Request prioritization** for critical operations
- **Graceful degradation** when limits are reached

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant RateLimiter
    participant API
    
    Client->>RateLimiter: Request
    RateLimiter->>RateLimiter: Check quota
    
    alt Quota available
        RateLimiter->>API: Forward request
        API->>RateLimiter: Response
        RateLimiter->>Client: Return response
    else Quota exceeded
        RateLimiter->>RateLimiter: Calculate backoff
        RateLimiter->>Client: Retry-After header
        Note over Client,RateLimiter: Client waits
        Client->>RateLimiter: Retry request
        RateLimiter->>RateLimiter: Check quota
        RateLimiter->>API: Forward request
        API->>RateLimiter: Response
        RateLimiter->>Client: Return response
    end
```

#### Versioning Approach

| Component | Versioning Strategy | Compatibility Policy | Deprecation Process |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WebSocket Protocol | Semantic (major.minor) | Backward compatible within major | 6-month notice before breaking |
| External API Clients | Explicit version header | Support latest 2 versions | Deprecation warnings in logs |
| Data Schemas | Schema version field | Migration scripts for upgrades | Automatic migration on load |
| OAuth Integration | Standard version support | Follow provider guidelines | Monitor deprecation notices |

The versioning strategy ensures:

- **Clear communication** of breaking vs. non-breaking changes
- **Graceful degradation** for outdated clients
- **Automatic updates** where possible
- **Explicit version negotiation** for critical interfaces

#### Documentation Standards

| Documentation Type | Format | Audience | Update Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API Specifications | OpenAPI 3.0 | Developers | With each release |
| Integration Guides | Markdown | Implementers | With feature changes |
| Authentication Flows | Sequence diagrams | Security team | With auth changes |
| Error Catalogs | Structured JSON | Support team | With error additions |

Documentation is maintained with:

- **Machine-readable formats** (OpenAPI) for tooling support

### 6.3.2 MESSAGE PROCESSING

#### Event Processing Patterns

| Event Type | Processing Pattern | Delivery Guarantee | Idempotency Handling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Messages | Publish-Subscribe | At-least-once | Message ID deduplication |
| Calendar Updates | Event Sourcing | At-least-once | Timestamp-based resolution |
| User Commands | Command Pattern | Exactly-once | Command ID tracking |
| System Notifications | Observer Pattern | Best-effort | Notification ID tracking |

The system implements these event processing patterns:

- **Publish-Subscribe** for agent-to-agent communication
- **Event Sourcing** for tracking calendar changes
- **Command Pattern** for user-initiated actions
- **Observer Pattern** for system notifications

```mermaid
graph TD

    subgraph "Delivery Mechanisms"
        H
        J
        M
        O
    end
```

#### Message Queue Architecture

The system uses a lightweight message queue architecture for agent communication:

| Queue Type | Implementation | Purpose | Persistence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Message Queue | In-memory with local backup | Agent-to-agent communication | Temporary (session) |
| Command Queue | IndexedDB-backed | User command processing | Until processed |
| Notification Queue | In-memory with local backup | User notifications | 7 days |
| Sync Queue | IndexedDB-backed | Calendar synchronization | Until synced |

Key characteristics of the message queue implementation:

- **Local-first design** with minimal server-side queuing
- **Prioritization** of time-sensitive messages
- **Delivery guarantees** appropriate to message type
- **Offline support** with local queuing

#### Stream Processing Design

| Stream Type | Processing Model | State Management | Scaling Approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Conversations | Stateful processing | Conversation context in IndexedDB | Single-client, no scaling needed |
| Calendar Updates | Incremental processing | Sync tokens and timestamps | Client-side only |
| User Activity | Event-driven | Session state in memory | N/A (client-side) |
| System Metrics | Windowed aggregation | Rolling windows in memory | N/A (client-side) |

Stream processing is primarily implemented client-side with:

- **Conversation tracking** for agent-to-agent communication
- **Incremental synchronization** for calendar updates
- **Activity monitoring** for user experience optimization
- **Performance metrics** for system health

#### Batch Processing Flows

| Batch Process | Trigger | Processing Strategy | Error Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Calendar Sync | Scheduled (15 min) | Incremental with sync token | Resume from last successful sync |
| Message Cleanup | Size threshold | Age-based pruning | Skip failed items |
| Data Backup | Scheduled (daily) | Differential backup | Retain previous backup |
| Index Optimization | Performance threshold | Background processing | Rebuild on failure |

Batch processing is designed to:

- **Minimize resource usage** during active user sessions
- **Operate in the background** when possible
- **Handle interruptions gracefully** with resumable operations
- **Prioritize user experience** over background tasks

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App
    participant BatchProcessor
    participant CalendarAPI
    participant LocalStorage
    
    Note over BatchProcessor: Scheduled trigger (15 min)
    BatchProcessor->>LocalStorage: Get last sync token
    BatchProcessor->>CalendarAPI: Request changes since token
    
    alt Successful API call
        CalendarAPI->>BatchProcessor: Return changes + new token
        BatchProcessor->>BatchProcessor: Process changes
        BatchProcessor->>LocalStorage: Update calendar data
        BatchProcessor->>LocalStorage: Store new sync token
    else API Error
        CalendarAPI->>BatchProcessor: Error response
        BatchProcessor->>BatchProcessor: Implement backoff
        Note over BatchProcessor: Retry later
    end
    
    alt User active
        User->>App: Interact with calendar
        App->>LocalStorage: Read calendar data
        LocalStorage->>App: Return processed data
        App->>User: Display calendar
    end
```

#### Error Handling Strategy

| Error Type | Detection Method | Recovery Approach | User Impact Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Network Failures | Timeout/Error codes | Retry with exponential backoff | Show cached data, offline indicator |
| API Errors | Status codes/Exceptions | Fallback to alternative flow | Graceful degradation, clear messaging |
| Data Inconsistency | Validation checks | Reconciliation algorithms | Transparent resolution options |
| Rate Limiting | 429 responses | Throttling with prioritization | Background processing, progress indicators |

The error handling strategy implements:

- **Proactive detection** of potential failures
- **Graceful degradation** when services are unavailable
- **Clear communication** to users about system status
- **Automatic recovery** where possible
- **Manual intervention options** for critical errors

- **Delegated Authentication** for secure identity
- **Publish-Subscribe** for real-time communication

#### Legacy System Interfaces

The system does not integrate with legacy systems in its initial implementation. All integrations use modern APIs with standard protocols.

#### API Gateway Configuration

| Gateway Aspect | Implementation | Purpose | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Client-side Gateway | Custom API client layer | Unified interface to external services | Service-specific adapters |
| Request Transformation | Request interceptors | Format standardization | Per-service transformers |
| Response Normalization | Response interceptors | Consistent data structure | Schema mappers |
| Circuit Breaking | Health monitoring | Prevent cascading failures | Per-service thresholds |

The API gateway layer:

- **Abstracts external service details** from application logic
- **Standardizes error handling** across different services
- **Implements resilience patterns** for all external calls
- **Manages authentication** for each service

#### External Service Contracts

| Service | Contract Type | Version | Critical Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI API | REST API | v1 | GPT-4o model availability |
| Google Calendar API | REST API | v3 | OAuth 2.0 authentication |
| Firebase Authentication | SDK + REST | v9+ | JWT validation |
| Socket.io | WebSocket | v4.x | Bi-directional communication |

Service contract management includes:

- **Regular monitoring** of API changes and deprecations
- **Abstraction layers** to isolate the application from external changes
- **Fallback mechanisms** for critical service disruptions
- **Comprehensive testing** against service interfaces

```

The integration security architecture implements multiple layers of protection:

1. **Authentication** ensures the identity of all parties in the integration
2. **Authorization** controls what actions can be performed by each party
3. **Data Protection** safeguards sensitive information throughout its lifecycle
4. **Communication Security** protects data in transit between systems

This multi-layered approach ensures that integrations maintain the system's privacy-first principles while enabling necessary functionality.

## 6.4 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

The AI Agent Network implements a comprehensive security architecture that prioritizes user privacy, data protection, and secure communication while maintaining a local-first approach. This section outlines the security mechanisms employed throughout the system.

### 6.4.1 AUTHENTICATION FRAMEWORK

#### Identity Management

| Component | Implementation | Purpose | Security Controls |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Identity | Firebase Authentication | Secure user identification | Email verification, account lockout |
| Agent Identity | Derived from user identity | Secure agent communication | Cryptographic binding to user |
| Device Registration | Browser fingerprinting | Suspicious login detection | New device notifications |
| Identity Federation | Google OAuth | Simplified authentication | Scope-limited authorization |

The system implements a user-centric identity model where:
- Each user has a unique identity managed through Firebase Authentication
- Each agent is cryptographically bound to its user's identity
- Agent identities are used for secure WebSocket communication
- Device registration helps detect unauthorized access attempts

#### Multi-factor Authentication

| MFA Method | Implementation | User Experience | Fallback Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Email Verification | Firebase Auth | One-time verification code | Account recovery process |
| Google Authentication | OAuth 2.0 | Single sign-on | Email/password fallback |
| Optional SMS | Firebase Phone Auth | Verification code | Recovery email |
| Recovery Options | Backup codes | One-time use codes | Support contact |

Multi-factor authentication is:
- Required for initial account setup (email verification)
- Optional but recommended for ongoing authentication
- Configurable based on user security preferences
- Balanced with usability considerations

#### Session Management

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Unauthenticated
    Unauthenticated --> Authenticating: Login Attempt
    Authenticating --> Authenticated: Successful Auth
    Authenticating --> Unauthenticated: Failed Auth
    Authenticated --> Active: User Activity
    Active --> Idle: Inactivity Timeout (15 min)
    Idle --> Active: User Returns
    Idle --> Expired: Extended Inactivity (1 hour)
    Expired --> Unauthenticated: Session Terminated
    Authenticated --> Unauthenticated: Explicit Logout
    
    note right of Active
        Full system access
        WebSocket connections active
    end note
    
    note right of Idle
        Limited background operations
        WebSocket connections maintained
    end note
    
    note right of Expired
        No operations permitted
        WebSocket connections closed
        Requires re-authentication
    end note
```

Session management includes:
- Configurable session timeouts (default: 1 hour of inactivity)
- Automatic session termination on suspicious activity
- Secure session storage using encrypted localStorage
- Clear session boundaries with explicit user feedback

#### Token Handling

| Token Type | Storage Location | Lifetime | Refresh Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication Token | Encrypted localStorage | 1 hour | Automatic refresh |
| WebSocket Token | Memory only | Connection duration | Re-authentication |
| OAuth Tokens | Encrypted IndexedDB | Service-dependent | Refresh token flow |
| API Tokens | Memory only | Request duration | None (single use) |

Token security measures include:
- Short-lived tokens to minimize exposure
- Encryption of all persistent tokens
- Memory-only storage for sensitive tokens
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Token revocation on logout or suspicious activity

#### Password Policies

| Policy Element | Requirement | Enforcement Point | User Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum Length | 10 characters | Registration form | Visual strength meter |
| Complexity | 3 of 4 character types | Registration validation | Real-time feedback |
| Common Passwords | Prohibited | Firebase Auth rules | Suggestion of alternatives |
| Password Reuse | Discouraged | Client-side hashing | Change reminder |

Password security is enhanced with:
- Client-side strength validation before submission
- Server-side enforcement of password policies
- Secure password reset workflows
- No storage of plaintext passwords

### 6.4.2 AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM

#### Role-based Access Control

| Role | Description | Permissions | Assignment Method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User | Standard platform user | Manage own agent and data | Default for authenticated users |
| Agent | User's AI assistant | Act on behalf of user | Created by user |
| System | Platform services | Limited operational access | System-assigned |

The authorization model is simplified due to the local-first architecture:
- Each user has full control over their own data
- Agents have delegated authority from their users
- System services have minimal access to user data
- No administrative roles with cross-user access

#### Permission Management

## 6.5 MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY

### 6.5.1 MONITORING INFRASTRUCTURE

The AI Agent Network implements a lightweight, privacy-focused monitoring infrastructure that balances system observability with the privacy-first principles of the application. The monitoring approach emphasizes client-side telemetry with anonymized data collection and minimal server-side monitoring limited to the WebSocket relay service.

#### Metrics Collection

| Metric Type | Collection Method | Storage Location | Retention Period |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Client Performance | Browser Performance API | Local with opt-in sharing | 30 days |
| WebSocket Server | Prometheus | Time-series database | 90 days |
| API Usage | Request counters | Aggregated logs | 30 days |
| Error Rates | Client and server logging | Anonymized error store | 60 days |

The metrics collection system follows these principles:
- No collection of personal data or conversation content
- Anonymization of all client-side metrics before transmission
- Explicit user consent for any telemetry sharing
- Aggregation of metrics to prevent individual user identification

#### Log Aggregation

| Log Source | Aggregation Method | Privacy Controls | Access Control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Client Application | Local storage with opt-in sharing | Data minimization, anonymization | User-controlled |
| WebSocket Server | ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) | No message content, connection metadata only | Role-based access |
| Authentication Service | Firebase Logging | Minimal PII, authentication events only | Admin access only |
| External API Calls | Request/response metadata only | No request content | Admin access only |

Log aggregation implements:
- Structured logging with consistent formats
- Privacy filters to remove sensitive information
- Retention policies aligned with data minimization
- Secure transmission of any shared logs

#### Distributed Tracing

Given the privacy-focused nature of the application, distributed tracing is implemented in a limited fashion:

| Trace Component | Implementation | Privacy Safeguards | Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WebSocket Communication | Correlation IDs | No message content | Connection troubleshooting |
| API Request Chains | OpenTelemetry (server-side only) | Anonymized request data | Performance optimization |
| User Flows | Client-side only with opt-in | Aggregated flow data | UX improvement |

The distributed tracing approach:
- Maintains user privacy as the highest priority
- Focuses on system health rather than user behavior
- Implements minimal correlation for troubleshooting
- Keeps detailed traces local to the client device

#### Alert Management

| Alert Category | Trigger Conditions | Notification Channels | Priority Levels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service Availability | WebSocket server downtime | Email, SMS, Dashboard | Critical |
| Error Rate Spikes | >5% error rate over 5 minutes | Email, Dashboard | High |
| API Quota Warnings | 80% of quota reached | Email, Dashboard | Medium |
| Performance Degradation | Response time >2x baseline | Dashboard | Low |

Alert management is designed to:
- Focus on service availability and system health
- Provide early warning of potential issues
- Enable rapid response to critical problems
- Minimize alert fatigue through proper prioritization

### 6.5.3 INCIDENT RESPONSE

#### Alert Routing

| Alert Type | Initial Recipient | Escalation Path | Response SLA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service Outage | On-call Engineer | Team Lead → Engineering Manager | 15 minutes |
| Performance Degradation | Development Team | Team Lead → On-call Engineer | 1 hour |

### 6.5.4 PRIVACY-FOCUSED MONITORING

Given the privacy-first nature of the AI Agent Network, the monitoring and observability system implements additional safeguards to ensure user privacy while maintaining system visibility:

#### Privacy Safeguards in Monitoring

| Data Type | Privacy Measure | Implementation | Retention Policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Identifiers | Anonymization | One-way hashing | 30 days maximum |
| Message Content | Exclusion | No content monitoring | Not applicable |
| Location Data | Aggregation | Region-level only | 7 days |
| Usage Patterns | Differential Privacy | Noise addition to metrics | 90 days |

The privacy-focused monitoring approach:
- Collects only the minimum data necessary for system health
- Applies privacy-enhancing technologies to all metrics
- Provides transparency to users about monitoring practices
- Allows users to opt out of non-essential monitoring

#### User-Controlled Telemetry

| Telemetry Type | Default Setting | User Control | Data Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Error Reports | Opt-in | Toggleable in settings | Bug fixing |
| Performance Metrics | Opt-in | Toggleable in settings | System optimization |
| Feature Usage | Opt-out | Toggleable in settings | Product improvement |
| Crash Reports | Opt-in | Toggleable in settings | Stability enhancement |

User-controlled telemetry ensures:
- Explicit consent for all data collection
- Clear explanation of data usage
- Simple controls for user preferences
- Respect for user privacy choices

## 6.6 TESTING STRATEGY

### 6.6.1 TESTING APPROACH

#### Unit Testing

| Framework/Tool | Purpose | Configuration | Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jest | Primary testing framework | Zero-config with Next.js | 29.0+ |
| React Testing Library | Component testing | DOM testing utilities | 14.0+ |
| MSW (Mock Service Worker) | API mocking | Network request interception | 2.0+ |
| ts-jest | TypeScript support | Type checking in tests | 29.0+ |

The unit testing approach follows these principles:

- **Test Organization**: Tests are co-located with source files in `__tests__` directories
- **Component Testing**: Each React component has dedicated tests for rendering and interactions
- **Service Testing**: Each service has isolated tests with mocked dependencies
- **Utility Testing**: Pure functions and utilities have comprehensive test cases

**Mocking Strategy:**

| Component Type | Mocking Approach | Tools | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| External APIs | Network request interception | MSW | OpenAI API responses |
| WebSockets | Mock implementation | jest.mock | Socket.io connections |
| Browser APIs | Environment simulation | jest-environment-jsdom | IndexedDB, localStorage |
| User Events | Simulated interactions | @testing-library/user-event | Clicks, typing, form submission |

**Code Coverage Requirements:**

| Component | Coverage Target | Critical Paths | Exclusions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core Logic | 90% | Agent communication, encryption | Third-party library wrappers |
| UI Components | 80% | User interactions, form validation | Visual styling components |
| Utilities | 95% | Data transformation, validation | Debug utilities |
| API Clients | 85% | Request/response handling | Generated code |

**Test Naming Conventions:**

```
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  describe('methodName or scenario', () => {
    it('should behave in expected way when condition', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

**Test Data Management:**

| Data Type | Management Approach | Storage Location | Refresh Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fixtures | Static JSON files | `__fixtures__` directories | Version controlled |
| Test Users | Factory functions | Test utilities | Generated per test |
| Mock Responses | MSW handlers | `mocks/handlers.ts` | Configured per test suite |
| Test Database | In-memory SQLite | Test environment | Reset between tests |

#### Integration Testing

| Test Type | Framework/Tools | Focus Areas | Environment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API Integration | Supertest, Jest | WebSocket server, API routes | Node.js environment |
| Service Integration | Jest, MSW | Cross-service interactions | Node.js environment |
| Storage Integration | Jest, fake-indexeddb | Local storage operations | Simulated browser |
| External API | Nock, MSW | OpenAI, Google Calendar | Controlled test environment |

**Service Integration Test Approach:**

- **Scope**: Tests interactions between multiple services without mocking internal dependencies
- **Boundaries**: Clear definition of test boundaries with external dependencies mocked
- **Data Flow**: Verification of complete data flow through multiple services
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive testing of error paths and recovery mechanisms

**API Testing Strategy:**

```mermaid

        C
        D
        E
        F
        G
    end
```

| Database Type | Testing Approach | Data Setup | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IndexedDB | fake-indexeddb simulation | Programmatic seeding | Query verification |
| SQLite | In-memory database | Migration scripts | Schema validation |
| localStorage | jest-localstorage-mock | Direct manipulation | Key/value verification |

**External Service Mocking:**

2. **Tablet (640px - 1024px)**
   - Two-column layout for main content areas
   - Sidebar navigation available
   - Expanded information display
   - Hybrid touch/mouse interaction design

3. **Desktop (> 1024px)**
   - Multi-column layout with sidebar
   - Persistent navigation and context panels
   - Expanded information display
   - Keyboard shortcuts and advanced interactions

### 7.4 ACCESSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS

The interface implements the following accessibility features:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - All interactive elements are focusable
   - Logical tab order follows visual layout
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Focus indicators visible at all times

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - ARIA labels for interactive elements

### 7.5 INTERACTION PATTERNS

#### 7.5.1 Agent Communication Flow

1. User initiates request via chat interface
2. Agent processes request and determines if agent-to-agent communication is needed
3. If required, agent connects to other user's agent via WebSocket
4. Agent conversation is displayed in real-time in a dedicated section
5. When a proposal is reached, user is presented with approve/modify/decline options
6. User decision is communicated back to the other agent
7. Upon mutual approval, the action is completed (e.g., calendar event created)

#### 7.5.2 Approval Workflow

1. Agent presents proposal in chat or as modal notification
2. User reviews details including agent conversation context
3. User selects approve, modify, or decline
4. If approved, action is completed and confirmation is shown
5. If modified, user provides changes and negotiation continues
6. If declined, other user's agent is notified and process ends

#### 7.5.3 Calendar Integration

1. User connects Google Calendar via OAuth flow
2. Calendar events are displayed in Calendar screen
3. Agent-scheduled events are clearly marked
4. Pending approvals are highlighted for user action
5. Users can manually add/edit/delete events
6. Calendar availability is used by agent for scheduling

### 7.6 VISUAL DESIGN GUIDELINES

While detailed visual design is not included in wireframes, the UI will follow these guidelines:

1. **Color Palette**
   - Primary: #3B82F6 (blue)
   - Secondary: #10B981 (green)
   - Accent: #8B5CF6 (purple)
   - Neutrals: #1F2937, #4B5563, #9CA3AF, #F3F4F6
   - Alert: #EF4444 (red)

2. **Typography**
   - Primary font: Inter (sans-serif)
   - Headings: 24px/20px/18px/16px
   - Body text: 16px/14px
   - Minimum text size: 14px

3. **Iconography**
   - Consistent icon set throughout the application
   - Minimum touch target size of 44x44px
   - Visual and textual labels for important actions

4. **Component Library**
   - Consistent UI components based on TailwindCSS
   - Standardized form elements, buttons, and cards
   - Responsive components that adapt to screen size

### 7.7 ANIMATION AND TRANSITIONS

The interface will implement subtle animations and transitions to enhance usability:

1. **Page Transitions**
   - Fade transitions between major screens
   - Slide transitions for hierarchical navigation

2. **Feedback Animations**
   - Button press states
   - Loading indicators for asynchronous operations
   - Success/error animations for form submissions

3. **Micro-interactions**
   - Subtle animations for state changes
   - Progress indicators for multi-step processes
   - Attention-directing animations for important notifications

### 7.8 ERROR STATES AND MESSAGING

The UI handles various error states with clear messaging:

1. **Form Validation**
   - Inline validation with specific error messages
   - Field-level error indicators
   - Form-level summary for multiple errors

2. **Connection Issues**
   - Offline state indication
   - Reconnection attempts with progress indication
   - Graceful degradation of functionality

3. **Agent Communication Errors**
   - Clear messaging when agent communication fails
   - Retry options with exponential backoff
   - Fallback suggestions when services are unavailable

### 7.9 NOTIFICATION SYSTEM

The application implements a multi-level notification system:

| --- | --- | --- |
| Auto-scaling | Request-based scaling | Cost optimization |
| High Availability | Multi-region deployment | Reliability |
| Zero Downtime Updates | Rolling deployments | Continuous availability |
| Resource Management | Per-container limits | Predictable performance |

**Rationale for Not Using Kubernetes:**
- Reduced operational complexity
- Lower management overhead
- Cost savings for a relatively simple server component
- Automatic scaling and management provided by Cloud Run

#### 8.4.2 Service Deployment Strategy

```mermaid
flowchart TD

    J --> L{100% Traffic?}
    L -->|No| H
    L -->|Yes| M[Deployment Complete]
    K --> N[Revert to Previous Version]
```

| Deployment Type | Strategy | Validation | Rollback Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard Release | Gradual traffic shift (20% increments) | Health checks, metrics | <2 minutes |
| Critical Fix | Immediate deployment | Accelerated health checks | <1 minute |

#### 8.4.3 Auto-scaling Configuration

| Metric | Threshold | Min Instances | Max Instances |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Concurrent Connections | 200 per instance | 2 | 20 |
| CPU Utilization | 70% | 2 | 20 |
| Memory Utilization | 80% | 2 | 20 |

**Scaling Policies:**
- Maintain minimum 2 instances for high availability
- Scale up quickly (within 30 seconds) when thresholds exceeded
- Scale down gradually (5-minute cool-down) to prevent oscillation
- Regional distribution to maintain global performance

#### 8.4.4 Resource Allocation Policies

| Resource | Allocation | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | 1 vCPU per instance | Sufficient for WebSocket handling |
| Memory | 2GB per instance | Accommodates connection state |
| Concurrency | 80 requests per instance | Optimized for WebSocket connections |
