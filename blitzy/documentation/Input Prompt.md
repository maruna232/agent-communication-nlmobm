# Input: **AI Agent Network for Seamless Scheduling and Communication**

## Platform Purpose

A **simple and reliable** AI agent framework that allows users to create personalized **lightweight AI assistants** capable of remembering personal details (e.g., preferences, schedule, location) while **storing all data locally** for privacy. These AI agents can **communicate with each other via WebSocket**, enabling seamless interactions between users’ agents.

Example:

- User: **"Agent, reach out to Maria’s agent and schedule a coffee chat at a time and place that works for us."**

- The user’s agent contacts Maria’s agent via WebSocket.

- Both agents check their respective users' schedules, locations, and preferences.

- The agents negotiate a suitable time and place via **a visible chat log in English**.

- Once both users approve, the meeting is confirmed automatically.

The platform is designed for **maximum simplicity and minimal bugs**, focusing on **user authentication, private local storage, and smooth agent-to-agent communication**.

# Platform Architecture

## Core Workflows

### **User Journey**

1. **Agent Creation & Setup**

   - User signs up & authenticates (Firebase)

   - User defines preferences:

     - Calendar access (Google Calendar integration)

     - Location (manual input)

     - Interests and general info like resume or a bit about user 

   - Local storage setup (stores personal data on user’s device or google drive)

   - WebSocket communication activated for agent messaging

2. **Agent Communication & Task Execution**

   - Users give **natural language commands** to their agent

   - Agent processes request and contacts another agent if needed (another user's agent)

   - Agents **exchange information transparently** via a **visible chat log**

   - Agents confirm details with users before finalizing tasks

3. **Task Completion & Confirmation**

   - Agent provides a **meeting proposal** (time, location) to both users

   - Users can confirm or modify the proposal

   - Once agreed, the agent automatically schedules the event in both calendars (optional)

   - Users receive a confirmation message

4. **Agent-User Interaction**

   - If an agent **needs more information or user confirmation**, it asks the user:

     - *"I need access to your schedule. Are you free on wednesday afternoon"*

     - *"Maria’s agent suggests 3 PM at Blue Bottle Coffee. Does that work?"*

   - Users can approve, decline, or modify suggestions

   - The agent handles the request accordingly

----------

## **Technical Stack**

### **Core Technologies (subject to change if you think another is better)**

- **Frontend**: Next.js + React

- **Backend**: Node.js (server-side WebSocket management)

- **Database**: Local vector database (e.g., ChromaDB, SQLite for local-first design)

- **User Authentication**: Firebase Auth

- **Local Data Storage**: IndexedDB or SQLite (encrypted for security)

- **Agent Communication**: WebSockets for real-time messaging between agents

- **AI Processing**: OpenAI GPT-4o 

- **Scheduling & Calendar Sync**: Google Calendar API

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging

### **Backend Services**

- **Local Storage for Privacy**: Agents store user data locally (preferences, calendar, location, etc.)

- **WebSocket Communication**:

  - Each agent has a **unique WebSocket ID**

  - Agents can send and receive structured JSON messages

  - Conversations are logged for transparency

- **Authentication via Firebase**:

  - Secure login (Google, email/password)

  - User-specific encryption keys to protect local data

- **Minimal API Calls to Ensure Low Latency**

----------

## **User Interface**

### **Required Pages**

1. **Home/Dashboard**

   - Overview of recent agent activity

   - Quick access to user preferences (calendar, location, food, etc.)

   - "Talk to My Agent" chat interface

2. **Chat Interface**

   - Text input for sending natural language requests

   - **Live chat log** showing agent-to-agent conversations

   - Approval/rejection buttons for scheduling confirmations

3. **Agent Settings**

   - User profile (edit preferences, location, availability)

   - Toggle WebSocket communication on/off

   - Manage connected agents (friends' agents)

4. **Calendar & Scheduling**

   - Google Calendar integration setup

   - View proposed and confirmed meetings

----------

## **Business Rules**

### **Access Control & Security**

- **All personal data is stored locally** (agent does not sync with external servers)

- **Users must authenticate via Firebase** to use the platform

- **Only trusted agents can communicate** (users approve friends' agents before interaction)

- **WebSocket messages are end-to-end encrypted** for secure communication

----------

## **Implementation Priority**

1. **Agent creation & local storage setup**

2. **WebSocket-based agent-to-agent communication**

3. **Simple AI logic for scheduling & preferences**

4. **User approval flow for scheduling events**

5. **Google Calendar & notification system**

----------

## **Agent Communication Protocol**

### **How Agents Talk to Each Other**

1. **User gives a request**

   - *"Agent, reach out to Maria’s agent and schedule lunch next week."*

2. **Agent opens a WebSocket connection** to Maria’s agent

3. **Agents exchange messages in a structured format**

   - **Example Chat Log (visible to users)**:

     - **User's Agent:** *"Hello Maria's agent! My user wants to schedule lunch next week. What times work for Maria?"*

     - **Maria's Agent:** *"Checking... Maria is available Monday and Wednesday at noon. Does your user prefer any cuisine?"*

     - **User's Agent:** *"Yes, prefers Italian. Any good spots nearby?"*

     - **Maria's Agent:** *"There's an Italian place both users like: Giovanni's Trattoria. Shall I suggest it?"*

     - **User's Agent:** *"Yes, proposing Monday 12 PM at Giovanni’s."*

     - **Maria's Agent:** *"Confirming with Maria..."*

4. **Users approve the final details**

   - The meeting is scheduled, and both receive confirmation

----------

## **Example Use Cases**

### **1. Scheduling a Meeting with a Friend**

- User: *"Agent, schedule a coffee chat with Maria’s agent."*

- Agent checks user’s availability → Contacts Maria’s agent

- Agents negotiate the best time/location based on calendars and preferences

- Users approve the final details → Meeting is scheduled

### **2. Handling an Incoming Request**

- Maria’s agent reaches out: *"Maria wants to have dinner this weekend. Available times?"*

- User’s agent checks availability → Suggests options

- The two agents finalize a plan → User confirms

### **3. Asking the User for More Info**

- Agent: *"I need access to your schedule. Please connect your calendar."*

- User: **\[Approves calendar access\]**

- Agent: *"Thanks! I now know your free times and will suggest accordingly."*

----------
