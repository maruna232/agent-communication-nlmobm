## 2. System Description

This section provides a systematic description of the AI Agent Network, including its purpose, components, and data processing activities.

### 2.1 System Purpose and Functionality

The AI Agent Network is a platform that enables users to create personalized AI assistants capable of communicating with each other to automate scheduling and coordination tasks. Key functionalities include:

- Creation and configuration of personalized AI agents
- Secure agent-to-agent communication
- Calendar integration for availability checking and event creation
- Natural language processing for agent intelligence
- Transparent agent conversation logs
- User approval workflow for agent actions

The system addresses the need for AI assistants that can handle interpersonal coordination while maintaining strict privacy controls through local data storage and end-to-end encryption.

### 2.2 System Architecture

The AI Agent Network employs a local-first architecture with minimal server-side components:

- **Frontend Application**: Next.js and React-based web application running in the user's browser
- **Local Storage**: User data stored locally using IndexedDB or SQLite with encryption
- **WebSocket Server**: Minimal server component for routing encrypted messages between agents
- **External Integrations**: Firebase Authentication, Google Calendar API, OpenAI API

This architecture ensures that user data remains on their devices, with only encrypted communications passing through the server infrastructure.

### 2.3 Data Processing Activities

The system processes the following categories of personal data:

| Data Category | Processing Purpose | Storage Location | Retention Period |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| User Identity | Authentication | Firebase Auth, Local Storage | Until account deletion |
| User Preferences | Agent personalization | Local Storage (encrypted) | User-controlled |
| Agent Configuration | Agent behavior | Local Storage (encrypted) | User-controlled |
| Calendar Data | Availability checking, event creation | Local Storage (cached), Google Calendar | User-controlled |
| Conversation History | User-agent interaction | Local Storage (encrypted) | User-controlled with auto-pruning |
| Agent Messages | Agent-to-agent communication | In transit only (E2E encrypted) | Not stored on server |

All processing activities are conducted with user consent and in accordance with the stated purposes.

### 2.4 Data Flow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the flow of data within the AI Agent Network:

```
User → Browser Application → Local Storage (encrypted)
                          ↓
User → Browser Application → WebSocket Server → Other User's Browser
                          ↓                      ↓
                    Google Calendar         Local Storage (encrypted)
                          ↓
                    OpenAI API
```

Key characteristics of these data flows:
- User data remains in local storage with encryption
- Agent messages are end-to-end encrypted during transit
- WebSocket server cannot access message content
- Calendar data is cached locally with user permission
- OpenAI API receives only the necessary context for processing

## 3. Necessity and Proportionality Assessment

This section evaluates whether the data processing activities are necessary and proportionate to the purposes of the AI Agent Network.

### 3.1 Lawful Basis for Processing

The AI Agent Network processes personal data under the following lawful bases as defined in GDPR Article 6:
