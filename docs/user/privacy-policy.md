# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** [Current Date]

This Privacy Policy explains how the AI Agent Network collects, uses, and protects your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have control over your personal data.

## Our Privacy Commitment

The AI Agent Network was built with privacy as a fundamental principle. Our local-first architecture means that your personal data stays on your device, not on our servers. We believe that effective AI assistance shouldn't come at the cost of your privacy.

### Key Privacy Features

- **Local-First Storage**: Your personal data, preferences, and agent configurations are stored locally on your device, not in the cloud.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All communications between agents are encrypted using strong cryptographic protocols.
- **Minimal Data Collection**: We collect only the minimum information necessary to provide our services.
- **Transparent Agent Communication**: You can see exactly what your agent is saying to other agents.
- **User Control**: You approve all significant actions before they happen.

## Information We Collect

We collect different types of information to provide and improve our services:

### Information You Provide

- **Account Information**: Email address for authentication purposes.
- **User Preferences**: Personal preferences for scheduling, locations, and communication styles that you configure for your agent.
- **Calendar Data**: With your explicit permission, we access your Google Calendar to check availability and create events.
- **Agent Configurations**: Settings that personalize your AI assistant's behavior.
- **Conversation Content**: Your interactions with your agent and the content of those conversations.

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Usage Data**: Basic information about how you use the application, such as features used and performance metrics.
- **Device Information**: Browser type, operating system, and device type to optimize your experience.
- **Error Data**: Information about crashes or errors to help us improve the application.

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do not access the content of your conversations with your agent unless you explicitly opt-in to share anonymized data for service improvement.
- We do not read the content of agent-to-agent communications, as these are end-to-end encrypted.
- We do not track your location unless you explicitly provide location preferences for scheduling purposes.
- We do not build behavioral profiles or sell your data to advertisers.

## How Your Data Is Stored

The AI Agent Network uses a local-first architecture that prioritizes your privacy:

### Local Storage

- Your personal data, preferences, and agent configurations are stored locally on your device using secure browser storage technologies (IndexedDB or SQLite).
- This data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption before storage.
- Encryption keys are derived from your authentication credentials using secure key derivation functions (PBKDF2).
- Your data remains under your control and on your device.

### Server-Side Storage

We store minimal information on our servers:

- Basic account information for authentication purposes
- Anonymous usage statistics (if you opt-in)
- WebSocket connection metadata (without message content)

We do not store the content of your conversations or agent-to-agent communications on our servers.

### Data Retention

- Local data remains on your device until you delete it or remove your account.
- You can configure automatic pruning of conversation history based on age.
- Server-side connection logs are retained for a maximum of 30 days for security and troubleshooting purposes.
- You can export or delete your data at any time through the application settings.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information for the following purposes:

### Providing and Improving Our Services

- To authenticate your identity and maintain your account
- To personalize your agent based on your preferences

We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

When your agent communicates with another user's agent:

- Communications are end-to-end encrypted using X25519 key exchange and XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption
- Our servers only route encrypted messages without access to content
- You can see the full conversation between agents for transparency
- You maintain control through the approval workflow for agent actions

## Security Measures

We implement strong security measures to protect your information:

### Encryption
