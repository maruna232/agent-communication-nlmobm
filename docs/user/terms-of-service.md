# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** [Current Date]

These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you and AI Agent Network ("we," "our," or "us") governing your access to and use of the AI Agent Network platform, including any associated applications, features, and services (collectively, the "Service").

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service.

## Overview of the Service

The AI Agent Network is a lightweight, privacy-focused platform that enables users to create personalized AI assistants capable of communicating with each other to automate scheduling and coordination tasks. The platform employs a local-first architecture that prioritizes user privacy by storing personal data on your device rather than in centralized servers.

### Key Features

- **Personalized AI Agents**: Create and configure AI assistants based on your preferences
- **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Enable your agent to communicate with other users' agents
- **Calendar Integration**: Connect with Google Calendar for scheduling functionality
- **Local-First Storage**: Your personal data remains on your device
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Secure communication between agents
- **Transparent Agent Conversations**: Visibility into agent-to-agent communications
- **User Approval Workflow**: Control over agent actions and decisions

### Privacy-First Approach

The AI Agent Network is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. Our local-first architecture means that your personal data, preferences, and agent configurations are stored locally on your device, not on our servers. For more information about our privacy practices, please review our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md).

## Account Registration and Eligibility

To use the Service, you must create an account and provide certain information about yourself.

### Account Creation

When you create an account, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

### Eligibility Requirements

You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Service. If you are under 18 years of age, you represent that you have your parent or guardian's permission to use the Service. Please have them read these Terms with you.

By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements that we outline in these Terms. We may still refuse to let certain people access or use the Service, and we reserve the right to change our eligibility criteria at any time.

### One Person, One Account

Each user may maintain only one account. Accounts are non-transferable, and you may not sell, trade, gift, or otherwise transfer your account to another person.

## User Responsibilities

As a user of the Service, you have certain responsibilities to ensure the proper functioning and security of the platform.

### Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to use the Service:

- In any way that violates any applicable federal, state, local, or international law or regulation
- To engage in any conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the Service
- To impersonate or attempt to impersonate another user, person, or entity
- To engage in any activity that could disable, overburden, damage, or impair the Service
- To attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the Service
- To use any robot, spider, or other automated device to access the Service
- To introduce any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, or other malicious code

### Agent Configuration and Management

You are responsible for configuring your AI agent and managing its settings. This includes:

- Setting appropriate preferences and parameters for your agent
- Reviewing and approving agent actions before they are executed
- Monitoring agent-to-agent communications
- Ensuring your agent does not engage in prohibited activities

You acknowledge that while the AI Agent Network provides tools to control your agent's behavior, you remain responsible for your agent's actions when interacting with other users' agents.

### Data Security

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and the data stored locally by the Service. This includes:

- Using strong, unique passwords for your account
- Keeping your device secure and updated
- Not sharing your account credentials with others
- Enabling additional security features when available (e.g., multi-factor authentication)
- Regularly backing up your data

While we implement strong encryption and security measures, the local-first architecture means that data security also depends on your device's security.

## Intellectual Property Rights

The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by AI Agent Network and are protected by international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.

### Our Intellectual Property

The AI Agent Network name, logo, and all related names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans are trademarks of AI Agent Network or its affiliates or licensors. You may not use such marks without our prior written permission.

All software, algorithms, functionality, and content provided through the Service, including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, icons, images, audio clips, digital downloads, data compilations, and software, is the property of AI Agent Network or its content suppliers and protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.

### Your Content

You retain all rights to any content you create, upload, or store through the Service, including agent configurations, preferences, and conversation data. By using the Service, you grant us a limited license to use your content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the Service.

Due to the local-first architecture, most of your content remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers. For content that is transmitted (such as during agent-to-agent communication), we only process this data as necessary to provide the Service and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

### Feedback and Suggestions

If you provide feedback or suggestions about the Service, we may use such feedback for any purpose without obligation to you. However, we will not identify you as the source of the feedback without your permission.

## Third-Party Services and Integrations

The Service integrates with third-party services to provide certain functionality. Your use of these integrations is subject to the terms and privacy policies of those third parties.

### Google Calendar Integration

The Service offers integration with Google Calendar to enable scheduling functionality. By connecting your Google Calendar, you authorize the Service to:

- Access your calendar data to check availability
- Create and modify events on your behalf (with your approval)
- Sync event information between the Service and Google Calendar

This integration is subject to Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You can disconnect this integration at any time through the Service settings.

### Firebase Authentication

The Service uses Firebase Authentication for user identity management. Your use of Firebase Authentication is subject to Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We only use Firebase Authentication for the purpose of authenticating your identity and do not share unnecessary personal information with this service.

### OpenAI Integration

The Service uses OpenAI's GPT-4o for natural language processing capabilities. When you interact with your agent, your commands and relevant context may be sent to OpenAI's API. We do not share your personal identifiers with OpenAI, and we minimize the data sent to only what is necessary for the requested functionality.

Your use of this integration is subject to OpenAI's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

### Third-Party Links and Content

The Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by AI Agent Network. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. You acknowledge and agree that AI Agent Network shall not be responsible or liable for any damage or loss caused by or in connection with the use of any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such websites or services.

## Agent-to-Agent Communication

A core feature of the Service is the ability for your AI agent to communicate with other users' agents to coordinate activities such as scheduling meetings.

### Communication Protocol

Agent-to-agent communication occurs through our WebSocket server using end-to-end encryption. This means that while our server facilitates the connection between agents, it cannot read the content of the messages being exchanged. Only the participating agents (and by extension, their users) can access the message content.

### User Control and Transparency

You have full visibility into the communications between your agent and other users' agents. The Service displays these conversations in a transparent, human-readable format. Additionally, your agent will not take significant actions (such as scheduling a meeting) without your explicit approval.

### Connection Permissions

Before your agent can communicate with another user's agent, both users must approve the connection. You can revoke this permission at any time through the Service settings. You are responsible for managing your agent's connections and for reviewing the content of agent-to-agent communications.

### Prohibited Communications

You agree not to use the agent-to-agent communication feature for any prohibited purposes, including but not limited to:

- Sending spam or unsolicited messages
- Harassing or intimidating other users
- Transmitting illegal content
- Attempting to circumvent the Service's security measures
- Collecting data about other users without their consent

We reserve the right to terminate access to the agent-to-agent communication feature for users who violate these prohibitions.

## Data Practices and Privacy

The AI Agent Network is built with privacy as a fundamental principle. Our local-first architecture means that your personal data stays on your device, not on our servers.

### Local-First Data Storage

Most of your data, including personal preferences, agent configurations, and conversation history, is stored locally on your device using secure browser storage technologies (IndexedDB or SQLite). This data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption before storage.

The local-first approach gives you greater control over your data and reduces privacy risks associated with centralized data storage. However, it also means that you are responsible for backing up your data and securing your device.

### Data Transmission

Some data must be transmitted to provide the Service's functionality:

- Authentication data is sent to Firebase Authentication
- Agent-to-agent messages are transmitted through our WebSocket server (with end-to-end encryption)
- Calendar data is exchanged with Google Calendar (if you enable this integration)
- Natural language commands may be sent to OpenAI's API

We minimize the data transmitted to only what is necessary for the requested functionality, and we implement strong security measures for all data in transit.

### Data Retention and Deletion

You can delete your account and associated data at any time through the Service settings. When you delete your account:

- Your local data remains on your device until you manually delete it or uninstall the application
- Your authentication record is deleted from Firebase
- Your agent connections are terminated
- Any pending agent communications are cancelled

You can also export your data before deletion for backup purposes.

### Privacy Policy

For more detailed information about our data practices, please review our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md), which is incorporated by reference into these Terms.

## Modifications to the Service

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service or any features or portions thereof without prior notice. You agree that we will not be liable for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Service or any part thereof.

### Updates and New Features

We may update the Service from time to time to fix bugs, improve performance, or add new features. These updates may be deployed automatically or require your action to install. By continuing to use the Service after such updates, you agree to the updated version.

### API and Integration Changes

The Service relies on third-party APIs and integrations that may change over time. We will make reasonable efforts to adapt to such changes, but we cannot guarantee that all features will remain available if third-party providers modify or discontinue their services.

### Notification of Material Changes

We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of material changes to the Service through the application interface or via email. However, you are responsible for reviewing these Terms periodically to stay informed of any updates.

## Termination

We may terminate or suspend your account and access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms.

### Termination by You

You may terminate your account at any time by following the instructions in the Service settings. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease.

### Termination by Us

We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, if:

- You breach these Terms
- We are required to do so by law
- We believe your actions may cause legal liability for you, other users, or us
- We decide to discontinue the Service

Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease.

### Effect of Termination

Upon termination of your account:

- Your access to the Service will be revoked
- Your agent will no longer be able to communicate with other agents
- Your local data will remain on your device until you manually delete it
- Any pending agent communications will be cancelled

The provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability
