# Security Architecture

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the security architecture implemented in the AI Agent Network. The system employs a multi-layered security approach that prioritizes user privacy, data protection, and secure communication while maintaining a local-first architecture.

### Purpose and Scope

This document details the security mechanisms, protocols, and practices implemented throughout the AI Agent Network. It covers authentication, authorization, data protection, secure communication, and privacy controls. This serves as the authoritative reference for security-related aspects of the system architecture.

### Security Principles

The AI Agent Network security architecture is guided by the following core principles:

1. **Privacy by Design**: User data remains on local devices with encryption, minimizing central data storage
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against different types of threats
3. **Least Privilege**: Components have access only to the data and resources they need
4. **Transparency**: Security mechanisms are documented and visible to users
5. **Data Minimization**: Only essential data is collected, processed, and stored

### Threat Model

The security architecture addresses the following key threats:

1. **Unauthorized Data Access**: Protection of sensitive user data stored locally
2. **Communication Interception**: Prevention of eavesdropping on agent-to-agent communications
3. **Identity Spoofing**: Verification of agent and user identities
4. **Server Compromise**: Minimization of impact if the WebSocket server is compromised
5. **Client-Side Attacks**: Protection against browser-based vulnerabilities

## Authentication Framework

The AI Agent Network implements a comprehensive authentication framework to securely identify users and their agents.

### User Authentication

User authentication is implemented using Firebase Authentication, providing secure identity management with the following features:

1. **Authentication Methods**:
   - Email/password authentication with strong password requirements
   - Google OAuth integration for single sign-on
   - Support for additional providers in future extensions

2. **Security Features**:
   - Email verification for new accounts
   - Password strength enforcement
   - Brute force protection with rate limiting
   - Suspicious activity detection

3. **Token Management**:
   - JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
   - Short-lived access tokens (1 hour validity)
   - Secure token refresh mechanism
   - Encrypted token storage in browser

### Multi-factor Authentication

The system supports multi-factor authentication to provide additional security:

1. **MFA Options**:
   - Email verification (required for all accounts)
   - Optional SMS verification
   - Google Authenticator integration

2. **Implementation**:
   - Firebase Authentication MFA integration
   - User-configurable MFA preferences

### Session Management

Secure session management ensures that authenticated sessions are properly controlled:

1. **Session Lifecycle**:
   - Session establishment upon successful authentication
   - Automatic token refresh before expiration
   - Configurable session timeout (default: 1 hour of inactivity)
   - Explicit logout functionality

2. **Security Controls**:
   - Secure storage of session tokens
   - Session invalidation on suspicious activity
   - Single active session per device (configurable)
   - Session monitoring for unusual patterns

### Agent Identity

Each agent has a secure identity derived from its user's authentication:

1. **Agent Identity Model**:
   - Unique agent identifier linked to user account
   - Cryptographic binding between user and agent
   - Agent public/private key pairs for secure communication

2. **Agent Authentication**:
