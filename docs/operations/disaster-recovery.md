# AI Agent Network Disaster Recovery Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive documentation of the disaster recovery procedures, strategies, and protocols for the AI Agent Network platform. It outlines how to maintain service availability and data integrity while preserving the privacy-first architecture during catastrophic events.

## Disaster Recovery Philosophy

The AI Agent Network disaster recovery approach is guided by several key principles:

1. **Privacy-First Recovery**: Maintaining the privacy-first architecture even during disaster recovery
2. **Local-First Data Protection**: Leveraging the local-first design to minimize data loss risks
3. **Minimal Server Footprint**: Focusing recovery efforts on the essential WebSocket relay service
4. **Geographic Redundancy**: Utilizing multi-region deployment for resilience
5. **Automated Recovery**: Employing infrastructure as code for consistent, repeatable recovery
6. **Transparent Communication**: Providing clear status updates during recovery efforts

## Recovery Objectives

The AI Agent Network defines specific recovery objectives to guide disaster recovery planning and execution:

| Metric | Target | Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recovery Time Objective (RTO) | <1 hour | Multi-region deployment, automated recovery |
| Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | <5 minutes | Stateless design, client-side data storage |
| Maximum Tolerable Downtime | 4 hours/year | High availability architecture |

These objectives are balanced with the privacy-first approach, recognizing that user data is primarily stored locally on client devices, which significantly reduces the risk of data loss during server-side disasters.

## Disaster Scenarios

The disaster recovery plan addresses several key disaster scenarios:

### Single Region Outage
- **Impact**: Partial service degradation for users in the affected region
- **Recovery Strategy**: Automatic traffic routing to healthy regions
- **Estimated Recovery Time**: <5 minutes
- **Key Components**: Load balancer configuration, regional WebSocket services

### Multi-Region Outage
- **Impact**: Service unavailability for all users
- **Recovery Strategy**: Deploy to alternative regions not affected by the outage
- **Estimated Recovery Time**: <30 minutes
- **Key Components**: Terraform deployment, DNS configuration

### WebSocket Server Failure
- **Impact**: Inability for agents to communicate
- **Recovery Strategy**: Redeploy WebSocket services from infrastructure code
- **Estimated Recovery Time**: <15 minutes
- **Key Components**: Cloud Run services, Terraform state

### Redis Failure
- **Impact**: Degraded WebSocket message routing between server instances
- **Recovery Strategy**: Restore from snapshot or create new instance
- **Estimated Recovery Time**: <10 minutes
- **Key Components**: Redis instance, connection configuration

### Data Corruption
- **Impact**: Potential message routing issues or service instability
- **Recovery Strategy**: Restore from backup or recreate clean instances
- **Estimated Recovery Time**: <20 minutes
- **Key Components**: Redis data, configuration data

### External Dependency Failure
- **Impact**: Feature degradation (authentication, calendar integration)
- **Recovery Strategy**: Graceful degradation, fallback mechanisms
- **Estimated Recovery Time**: Dependent on external service
- **Key Components**: Firebase, Google Calendar API, OpenAI API

## Backup Strategy

The backup strategy focuses on server-side components, recognizing that user data is primarily stored locally on client devices in accordance with the privacy-first architecture:

| Component | Backup Method | Frequency | Retention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Infrastructure Configuration | Git repository | Continuous | Indefinite |
| Terraform State | State file backup | After each change | 90 days |
| Redis Data | RDB snapshots | Hourly | 7 days |
| WebSocket Server Configuration | Configuration repository | Continuous | Indefinite |
| Monitoring Dashboards | Dashboard JSON export | After changes | Indefinite |

Client-side data backup is user-controlled through the application's export/import functionality, maintaining the privacy-first approach by keeping user data under user control.
