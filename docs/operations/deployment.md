Reference the staging deployment workflow configuration in [`deploy-staging.yml`](../../.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml) and the production deployment workflow configuration in [`deploy-production.yml`](../../.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml).

## Deployment Strategies

Documentation of the blue-green deployment strategy for staging and canary deployment strategy for production, including traffic management and validation procedures.

- **Blue-Green Deployment (Staging)**:
  - Deploy new version to a "blue" environment.
  - Test and validate the "blue" environment.
  - Switch traffic from the "green" environment to the "blue" environment.
  - Monitor the "blue" environment for any issues.
  - If issues are found, switch traffic back to the "green" environment.
- **Canary Deployment (Production)**:
  - Deploy new version to a small subset of users (e.g., 10%).
  - Monitor the canary deployment for any issues.
  - Gradually increase traffic to the new version.
  - If issues are found, roll back the deployment.

## WebSocket Server Deployment

Specific procedures for deploying the WebSocket server component to Google Cloud Run, including container building, configuration, and scaling parameters.

- **Container Building**:
  - Use Docker to build the WebSocket server image.
  - Tag the image with the Git commit SHA.
  - Push the image to Google Container Registry.
- **Configuration**:
  - Set environment variables for Redis connection, Firebase project ID, and other settings.
  - Configure resource limits (CPU, memory).
  - Configure auto-scaling parameters (min instances, max instances).
- **Scaling Parameters**:
  - Minimum instances: 2 (for high availability).
  - Maximum instances: 20 (for handling peak loads).
  - CPU utilization target: 70%.

Reference the Cloud Run service configuration in [`websocket-service.yaml`](../../infrastructure/cloud-run/websocket-service.yaml).

## Frontend Deployment

Procedures for deploying the Next.js frontend to Vercel, including build optimization, environment configuration, and CDN setup.

- **Build Optimization**:
  - Use `npm run build` to create an optimized production build.
  - Code splitting and tree shaking to reduce bundle size.
  - Image optimization to reduce image sizes.
- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Set environment variables for Firebase API key, WebSocket server URL, and other settings.
  - Use Vercel environment variables for secure configuration.
- **CDN Setup**:
  - Vercel automatically configures a global CDN for the frontend application.
  - Edge caching to reduce latency and improve performance.

## Deployment Verification

Approach to verifying successful deployments, including automated tests, monitoring checks, and manual validation procedures.

- **Automated Tests**:
  - Run unit and integration tests to verify code functionality.
  - Run end-to-end tests to verify user flows.
- **Monitoring Checks**:
  - Check service availability and error rates.
  - Monitor performance metrics (CPU utilization, memory usage, response times).
- **Manual Validation**:
  - Verify that the application is functioning correctly.
  - Check for any visual or functional issues.

## Rollback Procedures

Comprehensive procedures for rolling back failed deployments, including automatic and manual triggers, component-specific steps, and verification.

- **Automatic Rollback Triggers**:
  - Failed automated tests.
  - High error rates.
  - Performance degradation.
- **Manual Rollback Triggers**:
  - User reports of critical issues.
  - Security vulnerabilities.
  - Business decision to revert to a previous version.
- **Component-Specific Steps**:
  - **WebSocket Server**:
    - Redirect traffic to the previous stable version.
    - Verify that the previous version is functioning correctly.
  - **Frontend**:
    - Revert to the previous build in Vercel.
    - Verify that the previous version is functioning correctly.
  - **Infrastructure**:
    - Restore from the last known good state.
    - Verify that all resources are functioning correctly.

Use the `rollback_deployment` function from [`incident-response.md`](./incident-response.md) for rollback procedures.

## Infrastructure Recovery

Detailed procedures for recovering from infrastructure failures during deployments, including identification, isolation, and recovery strategies for different component failures.

- **Failure Identification**:
  - Monitor system logs and metrics to identify failures.
  - Use automated alerts to notify operations team.
- **Isolation**:
  - Isolate affected components to prevent cascading failures.
  - Reroute traffic to healthy instances or regions.
- **Recovery Strategies**:
  - **Compute Failures**: Reroute traffic to healthy instances or regions.
  - **Network Failures**: Activate alternate connectivity paths.
  - **Storage Failures**: Promote replicas or restore from backups.
- **Verification**:
  - Run comprehensive health checks on recovered components.
  - Compare system performance against baseline metrics.
  - Verify all services are operational.
  - Confirm data integrity across the environment.

## Secrets Management

Approach to managing secrets and sensitive configuration across environments, including GitHub Secrets, Google Secret Manager, and secure access patterns.

- **GitHub Secrets**:
  - Store sensitive information in GitHub Secrets.
  - Use secrets in CI/CD workflows.
- **Google Secret Manager**:
  - Store secrets in Google Secret Manager.
  - Grant access to secrets to specific service accounts.
- **Secure Access Patterns**:
  - Use environment variables to pass secrets to applications.
  - Avoid hardcoding secrets in code or configuration files.

## Deployment Monitoring

Integration with monitoring systems during and after deployments, including metrics collection, alerting, and dashboard updates.

- **Metrics Collection**:
  - Collect key metrics for all deployed components.
  - Use Cloud Monitoring to collect metrics from Google Cloud resources.
  - Use custom metrics to collect application-specific data.
- **Alerting**:
  - Configure alerts for critical metrics.
  - Use PagerDuty or Slack to notify operations team.
- **Dashboard Updates**:
  - Update monitoring dashboards to reflect the new deployment.
  - Verify that all metrics are functioning correctly.

Refer to [`monitoring.md`](./monitoring.md) for details on monitoring setup.

## Deployment Registry

System for tracking all deployments across environments, including metadata, success/failure status, and historical reporting.

- **Deployment Metadata**:
  - Deployment ID.
  - Environment.
  - Component versions.
  - Deployment start and end times.
  - Deployment status (success, failure, rollback).
- **Registry Implementation**:
  - Store deployment metadata in a database or file system.
  - Provide an API for accessing deployment information.
- **Reporting**:
  - Generate reports on deployment frequency, success rates, and rollback rates.
  - Use reports to identify areas for improvement in the deployment process.
