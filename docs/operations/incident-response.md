# AI Agent Network Incident Response Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the incident response procedures for the AI Agent Network platform. It covers incident classification, escalation paths, response workflows, and post-incident analysis, with a focus on maintaining service reliability while preserving user privacy.

## Incident Classification

Incidents are classified based on their impact and severity, using the following categories:

| Severity Level | Description | Impact | User Scope | Service Impact | Response SLA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 - Critical | Severe incident requiring immediate attention | Complete service outage or major data loss | All users | Complete Outage | 15 minutes |
| P2 - High | Significant incident impacting core functionality | Degraded performance or partial outage | Group of users | Partial Outage | 1 hour |
| P3 - Medium | Moderate incident with limited impact | Minor performance issues or limited feature impact | Individual users | Degraded | 4 hours |
| P4 - Low | Minor issue with no immediate impact | No noticeable impact on user experience | None | None | Scheduled |

The following table provides examples of incident types and their corresponding severity levels:

| Incident Type | Severity Level |
|---|---|
| WebSocket server outage | P1 - Critical |
| Authentication failure | P1 - Critical |
| API quota exhaustion | P1 - Critical |
| Data corruption | P1 - Critical |
| High CPU utilization | P2 - High |
| Elevated error rates | P2 - High |
| Performance degradation | P3 - Medium |
| Minor UI issues | P4 - Low |

## Incident Response Procedures

The following procedures outline the steps for responding to incidents:

### 1. Incident Detection

Incidents are detected through various monitoring mechanisms, including:

- [ ] Cloud Monitoring alerts
- [ ] Uptime checks
- [ ] Log analysis
- [ ] User reports

Refer to [monitoring.md](monitoring.md) for details on monitoring procedures and alert management.

### 2. Incident Classification

Upon detection, the incident is classified based on its impact and severity.

```
Procedure: classify_incident(alert_data)
Steps:
1. Analyze alert data and affected components
2. Determine impact on user experience (None, Minor, Major, Critical)
3. Assess scope of affected users (Individual, Group, All)
4. Evaluate service functionality impact (Degraded, Partial Outage, Complete Outage)
5. Determine incident severity (P1-Critical, P2-High, P3-Medium, P4-Low)
6. Identify initial response team based on affected components
7. Set initial response SLA based on severity
8. Return comprehensive incident classification
```

### 3. Incident Initiation

Once classified, the incident response process is initiated.

```
Procedure: initiate_incident_response(incident_classification, alert_source)
Steps:
1. Generate unique incident identifier
2. Create incident record in tracking system
3. Notify appropriate on-call personnel based on classification
4. Establish incident communication channel (Slack, video call)
5. Assign initial incident commander role
6. Begin incident timeline documentation
7. Update status page for user-impacting incidents
8. Initiate regular status updates based on severity
9. Return incident identifier for tracking
```

### 4. Incident Response

The response team works to contain, mitigate, and resolve the incident.

- [ ] Follow predefined runbooks for common incident types.
- [ ] Implement temporary workarounds to restore service.
- [ ] Identify the root cause of the incident.
- [ ] Implement permanent fixes to prevent recurrence.

### 5. Incident Escalation

If the incident is not progressing towards resolution, it is escalated to higher-level responders.

```
Procedure: escalate_incident(incident_id, escalation_reason)
Steps:
1. Retrieve current incident status and handling team
2. Determine appropriate escalation level based on incident severity and time elapsed
3. Identify next level responders (Team Lead, Engineering Manager, CTO)
4. Notify escalation targets with incident context and current status
5. Update incident record with escalation details
6. Transfer incident commander role if necessary
7. Ensure knowledge transfer to escalation team
8. Continue monitoring resolution progress
9. Return escalation success status
```

### 6. Incident Resolution

Once the incident is resolved, the following steps are taken:

```
Procedure: resolve_incident(incident_id, resolution_details)
Steps:
1. Verify that the incident is truly resolved
2. Document resolution actions and time
3. Update incident status to Resolved
4. Notify all stakeholders of resolution
5. Update status page for user-impacting incidents
6. Schedule post-mortem meeting for P1/P2 incidents
7. Collect relevant logs and metrics for analysis
8. Identify any follow-up tasks or improvements
9. Create tracking items for follow-up work
10. Return resolution success status
```

### 7. Post-Mortem Analysis

For P1 and P2 incidents, a post-mortem analysis is conducted to identify the root cause and prevent recurrence.

```
Procedure: conduct_postmortem(incident_id)
Steps:
1. Gather incident timeline and resolution details
2. Assemble relevant team members for post-mortem meeting
3. Review incident chronology and response effectiveness
4. Identify root cause through blameless analysis
5. Determine what went well in the response
6. Identify areas for improvement in detection, response, and resolution
7. Develop specific, actionable improvement items
8. Assign owners and timelines to improvement actions
9. Document findings and action items in post-mortem report
10. Share report with relevant stakeholders
11. Create tracking items for improvement actions
12. Return comprehensive post-mortem report
```

### 8. Disaster Recovery Assessment

In severe incidents, assess the need for disaster recovery procedures.

```
Procedure: assess_disaster_recovery_need(incident_id, incident_data)
Steps:
1. Analyze incident severity and projected impact
2. Evaluate affected components and service disruption level
3. Determine if standard incident response is sufficient
4. Assess estimated recovery time using standard procedures
5. Compare against Recovery Time Objective (RTO) requirements
6. Evaluate potential data loss against Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
7. Determine if multi-region failover is necessary
8. Evaluate if data restoration from backups is required
9. Consult with senior technical staff and management
10. Make disaster recovery recommendation (Yes/No)
11. Document assessment rationale and decision criteria
12. Return comprehensive disaster recovery assessment
```

## Escalation Paths

The escalation path depends on the incident severity and the role of the initial responder:

| Initial Responder | P1 - Critical | P2 - High | P3 - Medium | P4 - Low |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| On-call Engineer | Team Lead -> Engineering Manager -> CTO | Team Lead -> Engineering Manager | Team Lead | Add to Backlog |
| Team Lead | Engineering Manager -> CTO | Engineering Manager | Assign to Team | Add to Backlog |
| Engineering Manager | CTO | CTO | Assign to Team | Add to Backlog |

## Runbooks

Runbooks provide detailed procedures for handling specific incident types. The following runbooks are available:

- [ ] WebSocket Outage
- [ ] Authentication Failure
- [ ] API Quota Exhaustion
- [ ] Performance Degradation
- [ ] Data Corruption

## Incident Response Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|

- [ ] **Email**: For notifications and updates to stakeholders
- [ ] **Status Page**: For public updates on service availability
- [ ] **Video Conference**: For real-time collaboration and troubleshooting

## Post-Incident Analysis

Following incident resolution, a post-mortem analysis is conducted to identify the root cause and prevent recurrence. The post-mortem process includes:

- [ ] Gathering incident timeline and resolution details
- [ ] Assembling relevant team members for post-mortem meeting
- [ ] Reviewing incident chronology and response effectiveness
- [ ] Identifying root cause through blameless analysis
- [ ] Determining what went well in the response
- [ ] Identifying areas for improvement in detection, response, and resolution
- [ ] Developing specific, actionable improvement items
- [ ] Assigning owners and timelines to improvement actions
- [ ] Documenting findings and action items in post-mortem report
- [ ] Sharing report with relevant stakeholders
- [ ] Creating tracking items for improvement actions

## Improvement Tracking

Improvement items identified during post-mortems are tracked and implemented to enhance the system's reliability and security.

- [ ] Use a project management system (e.g., Jira) to track improvement items
- [ ] Assign owners and due dates to each item
- [ ] Regularly review progress on improvement items
- [ ] Verify that implemented improvements are effective
